# Word Count in Java

This is a MapReduce program in Java to perform word count.

The program takes two arguments. They are the path for the input file and the directory in which the output has to be saved.

####To submit this job in a hadoop cluster, run the command as follows:

```
hadoop jar pathtojar/WordCount.jar WordCount <input_path> <output_path>
```

Added sample input and output files too.
